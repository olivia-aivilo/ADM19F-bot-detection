{\small \em As public diplomacy or people's diplomacy is broadly being popular, a lot of government-sponsored institutions have bigger chances at communicating directly with foreign publics to establish a dialogue designed to inform and influence with the aim that this foreign public supports or tolerates a governmentâ€™s strategic objectives. As the international order has changed over the 20th century, so has the practice of public diplomacy. The biggest tool to influence via public diplomacy is social platforms, where we are getting used to bots that are trying to convince us to support some sort of ideas. On this paper we will concentrate on bot detection methods by analyzing the papers and coming to new decisions.

The problem we want to solve is the following:
\bit
\item GIVEN: a collection of $N$ sound clips, of similar duration,
      and each having a class label among $k$=5 classes
\item FIND: a clip-to-clip similarity function
\item to MINIMIZE: the classification error, in the 1-nearest-neighbor
      classifier.
\eit

This is an important problem, because $\ldots$
millions of dollars $\ldots$
millions of human lives $\ldots$

The contributions of this project are the following:
\bit
\item our proposed {\em someMETHOD} is novel, combining wavelets
      with a spike-removal  preprocessing step
\item it is effective, achieving 90\% classification accuracy
\item it is scalable, being linear on the number of sound-clips $N$.
