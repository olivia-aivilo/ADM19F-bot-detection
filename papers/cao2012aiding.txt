Main Idea: Cao, Sirivianos, Yang and Pregueiro build on previous work in \emph{sybil detection} that aims to use random walks to identify fake accounts (\emph{sybils}) based on key observations made on the structure of social graphs. Specifically a main assumption in these fake account detection schemes is that the connectivity between real users and fake accounts is limited and lower than the number of inter-user and inter-bot connections. In this work Cao et al. propose a new algorithm called SybilRank which, unlike previous work in the field, does not aim to make a binary classification of each user account but instead focuses on creating a ranking which allows for a measure of confidence in classifications as well as further challenges like \emph{Captchas} for suspicious accounts. The key idea behind this algorithm is that in a social network an early-terminated random walk starting from a real user account has a higher probability of landing at another real-user than at a fake account. Early termination is necessary for these random walks as the probability of landing at any node converges to a uniform distribution for random walks of sufficient length. The authors can thus use the degree-normalized landing probability of early-terminated random walks to rank nodes and leverage the fact that connections between real users and fake accounts are limited. They further propose a more effecient way of calculating the landing probability of random walks using power iteration.
