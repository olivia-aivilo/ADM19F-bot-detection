\paragraph{Main idea:}
Generally the researches on bot detection is based on particular botnet characteristics, but in this paper the authors develop three generic features to detect different types of bots regardless of their botnet characteristics. Sarah Harun, Tanveer Hossain Bhuiyan, Song Zhang, Hugh Medal and Linkan Bian~\cite{SarahHarun2017botnet} suggest five classification models based on those features to classify bots from a large, real-life class-imbalanced network dataset. The authors think that the generalized bot detection methods perform better than the botnet specific methods. 

The bot detection methodology is at first filtering out the unnecessary data and then apply feature extractor to the rest of data. Filtering : The authors filter the IPs which never act as a source and remove IPs which perform only single communication with other IP. After that the bots are extracted based on assumptions of bot behavior according to 1) Falling rate of communication frequency, 2) media communication frequency and 3) source bytes per packet for highest communication frequency.  To develop classification models using these features. The supervised learning algorithms like Quadratic discriminant analysis, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest neighbor and Random Forest are used. 

\paragraph{Use for our project:}
The classification results are analyzed according to 6 scenarios , as a result Quadratic discriminant analysis and Gaussian Naïve Bayes perform much better than others. These two supervised learning algorithms are closely related to the approach we want to take to classify accounts as bots or nonbot.
