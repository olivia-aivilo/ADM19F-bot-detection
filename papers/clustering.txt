Main idea: As opposed to previous literature which approaches the fake account classification problem on a per-account basis, Xiao, Freeman and Hwa suggest a different approach which uses an approach based on clustering instead. They suggest that as more efficient way of identifying a set of spam accounts made by a single spammer, one might classify entire clusters of users to be legitimate or fake instead of single user accounts. Furthermore their approach focuses on identifying and removing fake accounts before they can interact with legitimate users and spam the network so as to prevent damaging the experience of legitimate users. As they want to stop fake accounts as early as possible and only limited information becomes available during registration Xiao et al. focus on these few features which are available at registration time.
