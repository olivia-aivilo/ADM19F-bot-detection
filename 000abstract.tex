%What is the Biggest Enemy of Social Media and social platforms? In this project, we develop {\em BOT detection methodology}, since animated social agents, or bots are increasingly becoming a huge problem on social media platforms.
\noindent Due to their popularity online social networks are a popular target for spam, scams, malware distribution and more recently state-actor propaganda. In this paper we review a number of recent approaches to fake account and bot classification and propose our own method which combines these approaches to effectively utilize the network's social graph and its topology to improve fake account detection.
